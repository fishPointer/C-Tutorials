When running the C File in VSCodium, it automatically builds it into an untyped executable by the same name in the same folder.
I can run the program from terminal with
>./001
Which is pretty straightforward.

HOWEVER, If the program expects user input, the VSCodium "Output"Terminal will not function properly, as it is read only
In this case, just keep a terminal open on hand to run the code after it compiles...
OR You can just CTRL+ALT+N and then CTRL+ALT+M, then go back to the terminal 
OR You can just run >gcc 002.c -o 002, and then run ./002 over and over
    This seems to be the most convenient solution, as it doesn't force you from Terminal->Output every compiles



Template to Start Programs:

    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <stdlib.h>

    int main ()
    {


        return 0;
    }
